      <h2>What are watermelons?</h2>
      <p>Watermelons <em>(citrullus lanatus)</em> are plants that have fruits that are also called watermelons. Those fruits are berries that have a hard rind and no internal division. The rinds are usually green but sometimes they can even be black. The flesh is usually pink but in some instances, the flesh can be yellow. The yellow melons are typically described to have a "honey-like" taste.</p>
